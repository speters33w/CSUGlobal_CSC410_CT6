### Applying Probability in the Casino

A number of casino games are all about probability. In Blackjack,  there are rules which you should follow about taking a hit or standing  when the dealer is showing a 10.

Assuming that you are only using one deck, and there are only four  cards on the table. If you have a 10 and a 7 showing, the dealer has a  10 showing, calculate the probability of the dealer's other card being  an 8, 9, or a face card.

Explain why it makes sense to hit on a 16 but to stand on a 17. If  the house will stand on a 17 and above, how would you justify this  strategy?
